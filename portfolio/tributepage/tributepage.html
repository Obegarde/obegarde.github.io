  <li><strong>1990</strong>- Chemical production is again reorganized in France: Orkem's petrochemicals, styrenics, fertilizers and acrylics businesses are integrated into Atochem, while specialties (resin and paint) move to Total. Acquisition of Montedison's organic peroxide business.</li>
  <li><strong>1992</strong>- Atochem becomes Elf Atochem.</li>
  <li><strong>2000</strong>- Creation of Atofina by merging TotalFina and Elf's chemical businesses following the two companies’ 1999 merger.</li>
  <li><strong>2004</strong>- Creation of Arkema on October 1.</li>
  <li><strong>2006</strong>- Arkema IPO on the Paris Bourse on May 18</li>

  <li><strong>2012</strong>- in July, Arkema sold for 1 symbolic euro its vinyl products business segment to the Klesch group for reasons of profitability, but also to recenter its operations exclusively on specialty chemicals. As part of this divestment, Arkema made a 100 million euro cash payment to the Klesch group and took on debts amounting to 470 million euros to help revive the activity. In response to fears of redundancy and to protests from employees at a number of production sites, the trade unions negotiated, with the Arkema management, industrial and social guarantees as well as support measures designed to protect the rights of employees should the Klesch group implement redundancies following their take-over of the vinyl products activities. Hence two trust funds of €20 M were set up to secure compensation payments and the rights of employees of the companies that were sold off.</li>
